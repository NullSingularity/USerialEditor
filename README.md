# USerialEditor

This is a personal learning project to teach myself C# and .NET. This goal of this program is to provide an easy way to interact with, edit, and produce serialized object files in the format used and produced by the Unreal Engine 3 game "A Hat in Time", for the purposes of easier mod production.
